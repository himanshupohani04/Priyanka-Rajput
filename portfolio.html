          <b>Project Name: Nudra</b><br>
          We go where learners grow <br><br>
          <b>Project brief:</b>
          Nudra was designed to bridge the gap between career readiness and accessibility by reimagining how diverse learners engage with learning environments. The system consists of three interconnected components; Sprint (a six-week modular learning program), Tactyl (a physical kit that supports hands-on engagement), and Horizon (a digital platform that extends access and community). Together, they form an inclusive ecosystem that adapts to different learning needs, encourages collaboration, and empowers learners to discover their own pathways to success.

(Ideal Experience of sleeping) <br><br>
          <b>Project brief:</b>
          Ideal Experience of Sleeping<br>

This project explored the ideal sleeping experience for students using the Lextant research framework, for which I also earned a Lextant certification.We conducted interviews, observations, and emotional studies, then organized insights through affinitization to identify key patterns and opportunities.

To communicate our findings clearly, we created a magazine that visualized the research journey, emotional drivers, and user needs.

From these insights, we developed Sleep Tease,  a concept brand that transforms tea into a guided sleep-to-wake experience, helping students wake up effortlessly, feel detached from stress, and start their day refreshed.
